Abstract:
A point file to show the location of dams in the New York State Inventory of Dams.
A point file to show the location of dams in the New York State Inventory of Dams.
Purpose:
This dataset is used to show the location of dams in New York State's inventory of dams, and lists selected attributes of each dam.
This dataset is used to show the location of dams in New York State's inventory of dams, and lists selected attributes of each dam.
Supplemental_Information:
1.  While we try to maintain an accurate inventory, this data should not be relied upon for emergency response decision-making.  We recommend that critical data, including dam location and hazard classification, be verified in the field.  The presence or absence of a dam in this inventory does not indicate its regulatory status.  Any corrections should be submitted to the Dam Safety Section with supporting information.

2. There are approximately 15 dams not included in this dataset because they do not have X Y locations.

A feature class is created from data extracted from the Divison of Water's Dam Safety Section database.  Latitude/Longitude in decimal degrees is calculated from the latitude/longitude degrees, minutes, seconds fields extracted from the database.  Data is then projected to NAD83, NYTM Zone 18 from GCS, WGS 1984..
